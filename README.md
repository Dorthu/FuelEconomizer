# Fuel Economizer
### Track your Fuel Economy

Fuel Economizer solves a common problem - obsessing over the efficiency of your vehicle.  

## How does it work?

At the pump, open one of Fuel Economizer's frontends on your mobile device and record your odometer reading, how many 
gallons of gas you bought, and how much it cost.  It takes seconds, and Fuel Economizer will provide you with useful
data in return!

## What kind of data can I get?

Right now..nothing.  This is so early in development that it just accepts data right now.  See the issues section
for features coming soon!  And if you think of something I didn't, be sure to suggest it!

## I want to use Fuel Economizer, but I don't have curl on my phone..

That's fine, I wrote a mobile-focused frontend [over here](https://github.com/Dorthu/EconomizerWeb) which should get you 
started!  At present, registration is by request only, and not self-serve (message me and I'll get you set up).
